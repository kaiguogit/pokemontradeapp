Pokemon Exchange
=============

This is a 5 days mini project I made in lighthouse labs to practice Ruby and Sinatra.

There is no trading feature provided in Pokemon Go for now.

This web app simulates what offical website would do if they release trading feature.

People can add Pokemons to collection, wishlist, post them to trade listing.

Search other people's trade listing.

Make trade with pokemon or money.
